# Codejam Canvas

## Task

Your task is to implement 2 html pages to show basic [piskel clone](https://www.piskelapp.com/) interface (only markup) and canvas element (size 512*512) drawing 2 color matrixes

- size 4*4, data in folder data/4x4.json
- size 32*32, data in folder data/32x32.json

The data should scaled to canvas size.

Video as example what should be as result of the task (with extra scope)

Thanks Victor (@MitskevichVS) for the gif!

## Extra functionality
* Show image on the canvas, the image could be found in data/image.png
* Dynamic canvas size switcher to switch to 4x4 or 32x32 or image
  * in that case it could be only 1 file

### UX prototype
./data/rss-codejam-canvas.fig - to open from file in online / desktop editor

### Limitations
    - Should work in Chrome
    - Usage of material design or bootstrap is allowed
    - You CANNOT use any of the frameworks like Angular / React / Vue
    - You can use preprocessors 
    - You can communicate, chat, google and use stackoverflow
    - You can use lodash.js
    - You can just copy data from json file and insert it directly to your js file
    
### How to deliver
    - You can use your own private repo or public one
    - Create an files 4x4.html, copy data from json into js file and implement drawing 4x4 matrix
    - Create an files 32x32.html, copy data from json into js file and implement drawing 32x32 matrix
    - Implement additional functionality
    - Commit your code as you implement the features, i.e: 
        1. a base html file
        2. a basic layout with css 
        3. a layout for canvas 
        4. and so on
    - Deploy the code to github pages / netlify / https://surge.sh/ / other hosting and provide link in pull request
    - Create a PR from your branch (codejam-canvas) to master
    
    
## Requirements for commits, PR, repository
